## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Installation Instructions
To run the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luke-who/hangman182.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd hangman182
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Here I have used `Python 3.10.15`

## Usage Instructions
To start the Hangman game, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python hangman.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the letters of the word. You will have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
